# UIMATRIX - A design system and UI framework for Converged.


This design system is specifically designed to work with Corverged it will not be adapted for standalone use, this will create a very deep integration with the rest of the systems and save resources on implementing standalone optimizations.
## Philosophy
Scalability - working with different screen sizes. Work with different contexts, or manage a single piece of equipment or entire clusters of equipment.

Data driven interface.

Priority devices: 1 Tablets, 2 Computers, 3 Smartphones.

Hybrid interface - work both with a mouse for personal computers and active use of touchscrin.

Minimalism - avoiding unnecessary elements of decoration in order to easily maintain, expand and change.

Transboundary - all textual information must be available for different languages. This applies to fonts and keeping texts separate from the interface.

Modularity - easy reuse of different components in different contexts.

Work as an IDE - code editing, 3d model editing,

## FUI elements
- Colors - all UI elements without exception are managed from a palette, there may be several palettes, of which the main is black-white.
- Layouts - layouts of individual elements on the page.
- Themes - complex settings interface, including: colors, icons, sounds, images, fonts.
- Grids - grids including standard widths and heights of elements.
- Icons - sets of icons.

- Sounds - the sets of sounds, they are needed to organize the tactile interfaces, as FUI will be actively used by smartphones, tablets and other touch-screen devices.
- Typography - sets of fonts and text styles.
- Editors - the standard UI layout schemes in the mode of working as an editor. Editors can be different, for example: the editor of 3D objects, editor, code, text editor.
- Control Panels - one of the main functions of the framework is the control of equipment (industrial, scientific, measurement).
- Lists - various interface elements designed to display data sets, tables, lists, tiles, etc.
- Charts - a set of charts for displaying various data graphically.
- Localization - rules that change the interface operation depending on the language.
- Navigation - menus, breadcrumbs, navigation bars.
