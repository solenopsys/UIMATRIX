# UIMATRIX -  UI framework for HyperConverged based on MATRIX design system.


This ui framework  is specifically designed to work with HyperConverged it will not be adapted for standalone use, this will create a very deep integration with the rest of the systems and save resources on implementing standalone optimizations.

## Philosophy
**Scalability** - working with different screen sizes. Work with different contexts, or manage a single piece of equipment or entire clusters of equipment.

**Data driven** - configuring interface from data, not from code.

**Hybrid** - work both with a mouse for personal computers and active use of touchscrin. Priority devices: 1 Tablets, 2 PC, 3 Laptops, 4 Smartphones.

**Minimalism** - avoiding unnecessary elements of decoration in order to easily maintain, expand and change.

**Transboundary** - all textual information must be available for different languages. This applies to fonts and keeping texts separate from the interface.

**Modularity** - easy reuse of different components in different contexts.

**Work as an IDE** - content editing, code editing, 3d model editing, electronic editing.

## UIMATRIX elements

- **Layouts** - layouts of individual elements on the page.

- **Lists** - grids including standard widths and heights of elements.
- **Dialogs** - the popups, tooltips and dialogs.
- <span style="color:red">**Typography**</span> - sets of fonts and text styles.
- **Editors** - the standard UI layout schemes in the mode of working as an editor. Editors can be different, for example: the editor of 3D objects, editor, code, text editor.
- <span style="color:red">**Panels**</span> - one of the main functions of the framework is the control of equipment (industrial, scientific, measurement).
- **Lists** - various interface elements designed to display data sets, tables, lists, tiles, etc.
- **Charts** - a set of charts for displaying various data graphically.
- **Navigation** - menus, breadcrumbs, navigation bars.
- <span style="color:red">**Alerts**</span>  - everything about alerts, status bars, pop-up alerts.
- **Controls** - any separate elements: buttons, input fields, checkboxes, etc.
- **Forms** - organization of forms for entering information.
- - **Themes** - complex settings interface, including: colors, icons, sounds, images, fonts.
    Colors - all UI elements without exception are managed from a palette, there may be several palettes, of which the main is black-white.
    Sounds - the sets of sounds, they are needed to organize the tactile interfaces, as FUI will be actively used by smartphones, tablets and other touch-screen devices.

## UI Graphics sets

- **Images** - vector images for use in the interface.
- **Localization** - rules that change the interface operation depending on the language.
- **Icons** - sets of icons.
